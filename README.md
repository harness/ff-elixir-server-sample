# Before you Begin

Harness Feature Flags (FF) is a feature management solution that enables users to change the softwareâ€™s functionality, without deploying new code. FF uses feature flags to hide code or behaviours without having to ship new versions of the software. A feature flag is like a powerful if statement.

This is a sample app demonstrating Erlang Server SDK integration with CF in an Elixir app.

## Requirements
- Elixir
- Erlang

## To use this application, follow the steps as below ##

1) Create a project in Harness with Feature-flags module enabled
2) Create an environment within your project
3) Create a server-side sdk key in your environment **COPY the value from the Admin Console to your clipboard since this value will only be displayed once**
4) Create a boolean feature-flag in the admin console
5) Import the Elixir project in an IDE such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
6) Replace the values for SDK Key and feature-flag identifier in the example program from step 3 and 4
7) Run the program from the IDE

We are using the Erlang SDK as dependency for this sample program

Install dependencies using [Mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)
```shell
mix deps.get
````

Set Environment variable with SDK Key from `step 3` above.
```shell
export FF_API_KEY=YOUR_SDK_KEY
````

Compile the application
```shell
mix compile
```

Start the Elixir CLI
```shell
iex -S mix
```

Start the App and save the bucket pid
```shell
iex> {:ok, pid} = Elixirsample.start
```

Start the loop to print the flag value every 10 seconds
```shell
iex> Elixirsample.getFlagLoop(pid)
```
