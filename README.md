# Before you Begin

Harness Feature Flags (FF) is a feature management solution that enables users to change the softwareâ€™s functionality, without deploying new code. FF uses feature flags to hide code or behaviours without having to ship new versions of the software. A feature flag is like a powerful if statement.

This is a sample app demonstrating Erlang Server SDK integration with CF in an Elixir app.

## Requirements
- Elixir
- Erlang

## To use this application, follow the steps as below ##

1) Create a project in Harness with Feature-flags module enabled
2) Create an environment within your project
3) Create a server-side sdk key in your environment **COPY the value from the Admin Console to your clipboard since this value will only be displayed once**
4) Create a boolean feature-flag in the admin console called `harnessappdemodarkmode`
5) Import the Elixir project in an IDE such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

We are using the Erlang SDK as dependency for this sample program

Install dependencies using [Mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html)
```shell
mix deps.get
````

In your `config.exs` add your server-side sdk key from `step 3` above.
```Elixir
config :cfclient, api_key: System.get_env("FF_API_KEY_0")
````

Optional: to run multiple instances of the SDK for different projects you have on Harness, provide additional `project_config` options:

```Elixir
# For more complex applications where you need to use multiple Harness projects, you can start up additional
# SDK instances for each project by defining the below config and adding each instance to one of your application supervisors (e.g. the root supervisor)

# Instance for project 1
config :elixirsample,  project1:
       [
        api_key: System.get_env("FF_API_KEY_1"),
        config: [name: :project1]
       ]

# Instance for project 2
config :elixirsample,  project2:
  [
  api_key: System.get_env("FF_API_KEY_2"),
  config: [name: :project2]
]")
````
See `supervisor.ex` which adds the above instances to this application's root supervisor. 

Compile the application
```shell
mix compile
```

Start the Elixir CLI
```shell
iex -S mix
```

Start the loop to print the flag value every 10 seconds
```shell
iex(1)> Elixirsample.getFlagLoop()
```
